# Pafi
Pafi is a Discord that when you send him a spotify, deezer (only deezer for now) or soundcloud, he return all the information and links to listen it in other streaming platforms.

# How it's work :
Very simple : you send a link (for now only Deezer work), and it gives you informations about the music


# Contributors :
Me ([Pverte](https://github.com/Pverte)) is the only person now who is contributing at the code. If you wish to help me, don't hesitate !

# Invite the bot
For now, you can't invite the bot, because the code isn't at his 1.0 version, and I don't have hosting solutions.

### TODO list

- [x] Make the bot able to give informations with a deezer album link
- [x] Make the bot able to give informations with a deezer track link
- [ ] Make the bot able to give informations with a deezer artist link
- [ ] Make the bot able to give informations with Spotify links
- [ ] With /link the bot only gives links of the musics
