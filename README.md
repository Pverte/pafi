# Pafi
Pafi is a Discord that when you send him a spotify, deezer (only deezer and spotify for now) or soundcloud, he return all the information and links to listen it in other streaming platforms.

# How it's working
Simply /spotify or /deezer with the link of the song, of the album or of the artist and Pafi will return the informations.

## Features :
- Return all the informations about the music from the spotify API from deezer and spotify
- Return all the links to listen the music

# Invite the bot
For now, you can't invite the bot, because the code isn't at his 1.0 version, and I don't have hosting solutions.
